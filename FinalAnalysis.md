ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places") is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet.
Because there are 26 letters (2Ã—13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied.
the same action can be used for encoding and decoding. 
The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.[1]
ROT13 is used in online forums as a means of hiding spoilers, punchlines, puzzle solutions, and offensive materials from the casual glance.
