# Final-Analysis
- ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet.
- Because there are 26 letters (2Ã—13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse
- The cipher provides virtually no cryptographic security and is known for it being a weak encryption
